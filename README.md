# Portfolio Template

## CS50
>This was my final project for conclude the CS50 Introduction to Computer Sciense course.

>CSS, HTML, Javascript, bootstrap documentation, web development, CS50

My final project is a website that allows the user to insert their information and make the website their own portfolio

I have created many projects like these (portfolio pages about myself and my family) Although, this time I wanted to share the portfolio templates with more people and that's how I came up with this project.

Languages used:
HTML
CSS
Javascript

How does the webpage work?
The idea is simple. The user can enter his or her name on the home page. For the other two pages, they can insert their favorites and on the last page, you can change the background color and font style of a header.

Page Descriptions

There is a home page, a favorite book page, and favorite author page and a fun page as the last one,
On the home page, you can put in your name and a short description of yourself
    I used input statements for the name and description.
On the favorite author page, you can put the name and a description of your favorite author
    I used similar code like the first page but it is a bit different.
On the favorite book page, you can put some information about your three favorite books
    I used input statements to discover the title of the books they like and a description of the book.
On the last page, you can change the color and font styles of a header.
    I used this idea in my homepage project and thought to add it to this project
    I used functions in Javascript for the color changing of each color and then in my HTML, I had code for the buttons that instructed 'on click' run the function that causes the header to change background color according to the color button the user clicked.

I used Javascript for the last page so it can run the functions that change the background color of the header and add or remove font style
Most of my CSS was by Bootstrap -- Link: https://getbootstrap.com/
I added the source code in the html for the specific pages
